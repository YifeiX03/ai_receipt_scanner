In order to make an informed decision about this expense, I require a receipt image that clearly identifies the merchant, along with details regarding its location, service category, purchase amount, and the timing of the transaction. Without this information, I cannot appropriately assess whether the expense is allowed under the relevant policy. Please provide the necessary receipt image so I can evaluate the expense accurately.
